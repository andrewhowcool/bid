          <h1>A Brief Introduction to ALVB</h1>
          <img src="ALVB.png" alt="poster">
          <p>
            ALVB, short for "Ars longa, vita brevis" is a Latin translation of an aphorism coming originally from Greek. The Latin quote is often rendered in English as "Art is long, life is short".
          </p>  

          <p>
            ALVB brings an international audience of millions to the heart of the bidding action in art auctions across the globe. With fascinating objects up for bid in 47 countries—instantly translated to your language and currency—ALVB is a worldwide marketplace with treasures waiting to be discovered, whether you're an avid collector or a first-time visitor.<br><br><br>

            By hosting thousands of auctions in real time via the Internet, the site allows unprecedented access to remote sales, and savvy bidders can often land desired items at very desirable prices. Leave an absentee bid, or fully engage in the auction action—it's up to you. All bidding takes place via the Secure Bidder Network (SBN), which keeps absentee bids for upcoming sales private until the item is opened on the day of the sale.<br><br><br>

            ALVB revolutionized the industry from the start. In 2002, the NYC-based company formed a marketing partnership with eBay to introduce eBay Live Auctions. This alliance of ALVB and eBay enabled auction houses worldwide to go online with their live sales — a development that changed the auction business forever. In 2009, the debut of ALVB's iPhone and Android apps, with live-bidding capabilities, opened up a new mobile pipeline to bid anytime, from anywhere, with complete anonymity.<br><br><br>

            Now in its 11th year, ALVB has become the Web's leading auction-related site. ALVB also provides a constant stream of industry intelligence via:<br><br><br>
